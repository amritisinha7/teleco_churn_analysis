# teleco_churn_analysis
Overview
This project analyzes customer churn based on various service-related features such as Phone Service, Internet Service, Online Security, Tech Support, Streaming Services, and more. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, we visualized key patterns affecting churn rates.

Key Findings
Customers without services (like Phone Service, Internet Service, Online Security, Device Protection, Tech Support) have a higher likelihood of churning.

Lack of entertainment services like Streaming TV and Streaming Movies is also associated with slightly higher churn.

More active service usage correlates with lower churn, suggesting service bundling as an effective retention strategy.
